Question 7:
-X, --request <command>
       (HTTP)  Specifies  a  custom  request  method to use when communicating with the HTTP server.  The specified request
       method will be used instead of the method otherwise used (which defaults to GET).
-d, --data <data>
	(HTTP)  Sends  the  specified  data in a POST request to the HTTP server, in the same way that a browser does when a
    user has filled in an HTML form and presses the submit button. This will cause curl to pass the data to  the  server
   	using the content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
